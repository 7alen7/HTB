Fun fact, this word means “future” in Japanese(未来)! An initial nmap scan of the relevant target IP shows us that ssh port 22, DNS port 53, and http port 80 are all open. There are a few vulnerabilities for dnsmasq 2.76, but none of them seem to work here. So the next option is to run a bit of dirbuster on the ip and see what comes up. We’re going to use the “raft-small-directories-lowercase.txt” file for this first search. We find a lot of stuff in here relating to /versions/, but one directory that caught my eye was /admin/, so let’s home in on that. It looks to be an interface to a Pi-hole device with a login page. We get info about its version, and a graph that tells us there are 0 blocked DNS queries. Knowing the type of device this is, we can find the default login information. The default login for the web browser, ‘pi-hole’, doesn't give us anything good. On the other hand, the default login for ssh does seem to work, being ‘pi’ and ‘raspberry’. When we attempt to read the root file in /root/root.txt it gives us a hint that the root file was deleted, but there’s a backup on a usb drive. If we cd to /media/usbstick, we can see another message that states the file was deleted off the stick. Well, let’s take a look for backups. Typically, the /dev/sdb object will contain backup data from /dev/sda1 (the hard drive). Run strings on this db file to find the root key.
