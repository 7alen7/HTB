On loading into the challenge, we find that the only thing we can actually interact with on this page is the email booking box at the bottom of the screen. 
If we look at the python script, function blacklist_pass() is used to check for the “script” keyword within the email being passed. 
This means that we cannot use <script></script> xss in this example. 
However, we need to perform an XSS in order for the function send_flag() to be called as an exception will be thrown by ‘EC.alert_is_present’ without an alert on screen. 
For this reason, use <img src= “whatever” onerror=”alert(1)”>. 
This will produce an alert on the webpage as well as bypass the “script” filter.
